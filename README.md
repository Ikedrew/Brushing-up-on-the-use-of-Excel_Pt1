# Brushing-up-on-the-use-of-Excel

Part 1

To strengthen my technical foundation and boost productivity in a support or cloud-focused role, I’ve been actively brushing up on Microsoft Excel through guided labs on my Practice Labs account. My focus has been on practical, task-based learning aimed at real-world scenarios.

I didn’t initially expect to debug the code I was given to input into Excel, but I quickly adapted. I encountered formatting issues and experimented with different fixes — first by adjusting the quotation marks, changing from double to single. Then, after researching text import issues, I discovered that tab spacing was required instead of double spacing. I edited the data accordingly, replacing the double spaces with tab spacing. I created and tested four different versions of the document before achieving the correct format and was finally able to proceed with the lab.
